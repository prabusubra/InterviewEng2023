4. **How do you handle joins in Kafka Streams?**
5. **What is the difference between windowed and non-windowed joins?**

---

### **9. Kafka Connect**

   - Source Connector
   - Sink Connector
3. **How do you configure a Kafka Connect connector?**
4. **What is the difference between distributed and standalone modes in Kafka Connect?**
5. **What are some common use cases of Kafka Connect at Walmart-scale operations?**

---

### **10. Kafka Security**
1. **How do you secure a Kafka cluster?**
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - Authentication
   - Authorization (ACLs)
2. **How do you configure SSL for Kafka brokers and clients?**
3. **What is SASL, and how does it integrate with Kafka?**
4. **How do you enforce topic-level permissions in Kafka?**
5. **What are the best practices for securing a Kafka cluster?**

---

### **11. Real-World Scenarios**
1. **How would you design a Kafka-based system for Walmart’s order processing?**
2. **How can Kafka help in managing Walmart’s inventory system in real-time?**
3. **What would you do if a Kafka consumer lags behind significantly?**
4. **Describe how you’d handle a Kafka topic that is receiving data faster than the consumer can process it.**
5. **Explain a challenge you faced with Kafka in a production environment and how you resolved it.**

---

### **12. Troubleshooting and Maintenance**
1. **What would you do if Kafka brokers are running out of disk space?**
2. **How do you debug consumer lag issues in Kafka?**
3. **How do you handle topic rebalancing in Kafka?**
4. **What are some common Kafka errors, and how do you resolve them?**
5. **How would you upgrade a Kafka cluster without downtime?**

---

### **Preparation Tips**
- **Know the Basics**: Be clear on Kafka architecture, message flow, and configurations.
- **Focus on Scaling**: Walmart deals with high throughput; expect questions about Kafka’s scalability and performance tuning.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Think about how Kafka can solve problems related to Walmart-scale systems (e.g., order processing, inventory tracking, real-time analytics).
- **Hands-On Practice**: Set up Kafka locally, write producers and consumers, and experiment with configurations.
- **Kafka Monitoring**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Confluent Control Center for monitoring Kafka.

By focusing on these areas, you'll be well-prepared for Kafka-related questions in your Walmart interview.
