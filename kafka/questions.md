When interviewing for a Kafka-related role at a company like Walmart, you might encounter questions covering a broad range of topics, including Kafka architecture, real-world use cases, and troubleshooting scenarios. Below is a list of **Kafka interview questions** you might expect, categorized into various topics.

---

### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is Apache Kafka?**
   - Explain Kafka's role as a distributed messaging system, its use cases, and core components (topics, producers, consumers, brokers).

2. **What are the main components of Kafka?**
   - Topics, Partitions, Brokers, Producers, Consumers, Zookeeper (or KRaft in modern Kafka), and Offset management.

3. **Explain the role of Zookeeper in Kafka.**
   - Role in leader election, topic metadata storage, configuration management, and its replacement by KRaft in newer versions.

4. **How does Kafka achieve high throughput?**
   - Concepts like sequential disk I/O, compression, partitioning, and batching.

5. **What is a Kafka topic, and how are partitions related to topics?**
   - Explanation of topics as logical channels and partitions as units of parallelism.

---

### **Intermediate Questions**
1. **How does Kafka ensure message durability?**
   - Acknowledgment mechanisms, replication, and commit log.

2. **What is the role of partitions in Kafka?**
   - Explain scalability, parallelism, and how partitions allow multiple consumers to read simultaneously.

3. **What is Kafka's exactly-once semantics (EOS)?**
   - Describe idempotent producers, transactional topics, and how Kafka guarantees EOS.

4. **What is a consumer group, and why is it important?**
   - Describe how Kafka uses consumer groups to distribute messages across consumers.

5. **What are Kafka offsets, and how are they managed?**
   - Discuss offset storage (Zookeeper, Kafka, or an external store), manual vs. automatic offset commit.

6. **How does Kafka handle message retention?**
   - Retention policies (time-based, size-based), compaction, and delete policies.

---

### **Advanced Questions**
1. **How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?**
   - Broker replication, leader election, and ISR (In-Sync Replicas).

2. **What is the difference between Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect?**
   - Kafka Streams for real-time stream processing, and Kafka Connect for integration with external systems.

3. **How does Kafka handle backpressure in consumers?**
   - Discuss consumer lag, poll timeout, and flow control strategies.

4. **Explain the Kafka producer acknowledgment modes.**
   - `acks=0`, `acks=1`, and `acks=all`.

5. **What is Kafka's replication factor, and why is it important?**
   - Ensures high availability by replicating partitions across multiple brokers.

6. **How would you monitor Kafka performance?**
   - Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Confluent Control Center, and key metrics like consumer lag, broker health, and throughput.

### **Scenario-Based Questions**
1. **How would you troubleshoot high consumer lag in Kafka?**
   - Discuss analyzing consumer logs, increasing consumer processing capacity, and partition distribution.

2. **What would you do if a Kafka broker goes down?**
   - Explain leader election, ISR, and how replication ensures availability.

3. **How would you scale a Kafka cluster?**
   - Adding brokers, partition rebalancing, increasing partitions, and tuning configurations.

4. **What happens if a Kafka producer sends messages faster than consumers can process them?**
   - Discuss implications like growing consumer lag, backpressure, and retention limit issues.

5. **How would you implement a real-time inventory management system using Kafka?**
   - Discuss producers, topics for events (e.g., inventory updates), consumers for processing, and stream processing for aggregations.

---

### **Walmart-Specific or Business-Oriented Questions**
1. **How would you use Kafka in a Walmart e-commerce platform?**
   - Discuss use cases like order processing, inventory updates, recommendation engines, and real-time analytics.

2. **Describe how Kafka can be used for event-driven architecture in Walmart's supply chain.**
   - Discuss event streams for order tracking, shipment updates, and inventory synchronization.

3. **How would you handle a surge in traffic (e.g., Black Friday sales) in Kafka?**
   - Strategies for scaling Kafka, tuning producer/consumer throughput, and monitoring.

4. **What is your approach to ensuring data consistency across multiple Kafka consumers?**
   - Use of consumer groups, transactional topics, and idempotency.

5. **Explain how you would optimize Kafka performance in a high-traffic environment like Walmart's website.**
   - Partitioning strategies, replication tuning, compression, and monitoring.

---

### **Hands-On or Coding Challenges**
1. Write a Kafka producer and consumer in Java/Python.
2. Given a specific dataset, demonstrate how to partition data effectively in Kafka.
3. Set up a Kafka Connect pipeline to sync data from MySQL to Kafka and then to Elasticsearch.
4. Analyze a Kafka log file and identify potential issues with broker communication or message delivery.

By preparing for these questions and scenarios, you’ll be well-equipped to demonstrate your Kafka knowledge and its application to Walmart’s high-scale systems.
